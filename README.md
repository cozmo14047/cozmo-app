# cozmo-app
Hi there this is and app using the pycozmo python package it will currently use python if i get enough intreast it will be made into an actual app.
any features you would like make an issue. it is currently in beta stages and is not the best at this current time.
if there is anyone out there who knows or can record the sound without background noise that cozmo makes when he wakes up i would much apreciate it.


# How to setup

In order to run use command pip install pycozmo. 
pip install ffmpeg
then run the python file.
# Things to do 
Make live camera stream: not sure how to do yet
Add controlls to move cozmo: not sure what the buttons should look like yet
change the sounds to cozmos actual sounds: i dont have the sounds so canot do this
